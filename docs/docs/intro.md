# Project setup guide

Let's discover **Crypto Tracker in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **cloning the repo**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Install Dependencies

Go to the folder /web-app.

The dependecies will be added after you run the command:

```bash
cd web-app
npm install
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Crypto Tracker.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
